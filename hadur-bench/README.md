# hadur-bench

Headless Robocode battles for measuring Hadur (stage S0 of the Hadur 2 plan), and the
recorder that captures the core's replay fixtures (S1).

The bench runs the full Robocode 1.9.5.6 engine from Maven Central, with the security
manager on. Each battle runs in its own JVM with `-DRANDOMSEED=<battle number>`, so the
same command gives the same result every time.

## Running

```sh
mvn package -DskipTests                    # build the robot jar (repo root)
cd hadur-bench
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="--mode cold --rounds 35 --seeds 5"
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--mode cold\|warm` | cold | cold wipes Hadur's data directory before every battle; warm keeps it across consecutive battles and reports the learning curve |
| `--rounds N` | 35 | rounds per battle |
| `--seeds N` | 5 | battles per opponent (cold) |
| `--battles N` | 5 | consecutive battles per opponent (warm) |
| `--field WxH` | 800x600 | battlefield size |
| `--robot-jar FILE` | ../hadur-robot/target/hadur2.Hadur_2.0.jar | the robot jar |
| `--robot-classes DIR` | | jar a compiled class tree instead, e.g. an older Hadur |
| `--robot NAME` | hadur2.Hadur 2.0 | the robot's name as Robocode lists it |
| `--record DIR` | | capture replay fixtures instead (see below) |
| `--only TEXT` | | run only opponents whose name contains TEXT |
| `--out DIR` | work/&lt;mode&gt;-&lt;time&gt; | working directory (Robocode home, logs) |
| `--report FILE` | | also write the report there, e.g. `../docs/bench/…` |

The command exits non-zero if any battle fails.

## Opponents

`reference-set.txt` lists them. Sample bots ship with the engine. Other bots go in
`opponents/` as jars (not committed) and are listed with their jar name.

## Output

Each battle directory under `work/…/battles/` holds:

- `result.csv`: scores, survival, bullet damage for both robots, skipped turns, turn times,
  and what Hadur's own `R` and `FAULT` records said (hit rates, faults).
- `hadur.log`: everything Hadur printed, as `round,turn,line`.
- `truth.log.gz`: one `T,round,turn,…` record per turn with both robots' true x, y,
  heading, velocity, energy and every live bullet as `owner:x:y:heading:power`
  (owner `H` is Hadur, `E` the enemy). The first line is `V,1`.
- `engine.log`: the engine's own output.

`report.md` in the working directory is the summary table.

The report's hit-rate and fault columns come from Hadur's `R` (round end) and `FAULT`
records, so every fault and degradation counter the core keeps reaches the report (RES-5).

## Replay fixtures

```sh
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="--record ../hadur-core/src/test/resources/replay --seeds 1 --rounds 3"
```

Runs `hadur2.HadurRecorder` (the robot plus a transcript of every `BotInput` and the
`BotOrders` it issued) with Robocode's security off, and writes one gzipped transcript
per opponent. hadur-core's replay tests feed each transcript through a fresh core and
require the same orders, bit for bit (CORE-2). Re-record whenever a change is meant to
alter Hadur's behaviour; a replay that breaks without such a change is a regression.
